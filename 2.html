  Fashion has a huge impact on the world and the people around us, but not all of it is positive.

The fashion industry is the second most polluting industry in the world after oil and is a large contributor to global warming, accounting for approximately 10% of global carbon emissions1. Enormous amounts of energy and resources go into producing the fabrics we wear. There are also some not-so-pretty side effects from fashion manufacturing that affect workers and our environment. For example:

<p><p><p>
  <p style="margin-bottom: 4px;">

</p>
